# MTGPriceChecker

## Introduction
This is a personal project of mine to create an app that checks the price of Magic: The Gathering (MTG) trading cards.
When opening packs of MTG cards this app allows the user to quickly check the current market price of MTG cards.
Currently only Standard-legal sets are included. More cards will be added later on.

First screen shows the the expansion sets that are currently in the Standard-legal format right now, and once you choose your set, it jumps right into the cards pricings in that set in USD.
